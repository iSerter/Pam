PAM
=========

PAM (Personal Assistant Mockery) is a Siri-like software. I created her to be a dummy project for my learning practices. 
It really isn't useful at all. It's just a code playground for me.


History
----

I needed a dummy project to practice unit testing in PHP, and I realized how often I need such dummy projects. I decided to collect all my learning practices in one big project that I can showcase on Github. Yes, despite the number of projects I have built, none was worth publishing. 
I wanted to build something that is open to extending its functionality to utterly useless points. Well, what's better than a human at it? So I decided to fake one :) 


Etymology
----

While thinking for a name, I was inspired by the movie "Transcendence", and the character PINN. I wanted an acronym that is fun to call, and has a meaning. Therefore, PAM, Personal Assistant Mockery, was decided.
