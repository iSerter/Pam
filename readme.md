PAM
=========

PAM (Personal Assistant Mockery) is a Siri-like software with a command line interface. I created her to be a dummy project for my learning practices. 

This isn't a project to have any future or usability whatsoever. It's just a dummy project to showcase my personal knowledge and support my resume. 


History
----

I needed a dummy project to practice unit testing in PHP, and I realized how often I need such dummy projects. 
Also, I've been wanting to showcase my skills on Github, but all my projects have been private and I don't have any time to develop anything real for the community. 
I experiment new things and expand my knowledge with the little free time I get, but these dummy projects are usually too simple to showcase.
Therefore, I decided to collect all my learning practices in one big project that I can put on Github to showcase my skills. 
So, I created Pam: a silly playground for learning new programming concepts. 


Etymology
----

While thinking for a name, I was inspired by the movie "Transcendence", and the character PINN. I wanted an acronym that is fun to call, and has a meaning. Therefore, PAM, Personal Assistant Mockery, was decided.
